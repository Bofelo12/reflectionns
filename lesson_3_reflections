when would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
when I am collaborating with other people on a project 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
So that you can be able to solve errors as they arise

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
